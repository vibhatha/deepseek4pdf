Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the main topics are in this document based on the context information provided. Let me start by reading through the given information carefully.

First, there's a section labeled "page_label: 2" with file_path pointing to some PDF. The heading here is "I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m%;h - 2023'05'30". I'm not sure what this means exactly, but the context includes several tabs. Each tab has two parts: a heading and some numbered items.

Looking at the first tab (I), it seems to be about different ministers from various departments mentioned in the notification. The headings are "02. Minister of Finance", "03. Minister of Technology", "06. Minister of Investment Promotion", "08. Minister of Fisheries", "12. Minister of Health", and "18. Minister of Plantation Industries". Each section lists specific ministers, like the Chief Minister of finance for SRI Lanka, and others with their positions and roles.

Then there are other tabs (II) discussing various topics such as tourism, education, infrastructure, etc. The sections under these include things like Colombo Lotus Tower becoming a business model, infrastructure projects from Sri Lanka Telecom and North Sea Ltd., and so on. Each of these sections seems to cover specific areas within the document.

So putting it all together, the main topics discussed in the document are the different ministers from various departments of SRI LANKA, including finance, technology, investment promotion, Fisheries, Health, and Plantation Industries. There's also a focus on tourism-related projects and infrastructure developments under other sections.
